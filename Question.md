# Game Deals
Build a simple website in react that shows game deals using the public api from [CheapShark.com](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/#c58ecff8-ee51-2901-f263-8606e8dc281e).

## UI Requirements
- A search box to search the game
- A list view to show the search result.
- Minimum Information to display on list view:  
    - Game title
    - Game thumbnail.
- The list item should be clickable and should show further information about the game upon clicking.
- Minimum Information to display on Game info:
    - Game title
    - Thumbnail
    - Cheapest price
    - List of all available deals

## API
The required data for the UI is to be fetched from cheapsharkâ€™s public api. The [List of Games](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/#e3d7f1f0-f7a4-b36a-587a-6514a40f4d88) and [Game Lookup](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/#e3d7f1f0-f7a4-b36a-587a-6514a40f4d88) endpoints are the ones we are interested in. Bonus points if you can integrate other endpoints from cheapshark  to enhance the UI.
